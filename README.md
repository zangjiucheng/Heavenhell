# 😇 Heaven or Hall 😈  
*Welcome to the afterlife’s least qualified HR department.*

## 🕹️ Overview  
You are the newest (and probably last) **Afterlife Clerk** hired by the Department of Eternal Sorting™.  
Your job? Simple!  
Read what the souls say, check today’s newspaper, and decide whether they deserve to spend eternity in **Heaven**... or take a quick elevator ride down to **Hall** (our slightly off-brand version of Hell — cheaper rent, worse Wi-Fi).  

What could possibly go wrong?  
...other than eternal damnation for administrative error, of course.

## ☁️ The Story  
It’s the year 1955-ish. Heaven’s bureaucracy has merged with Hell’s customer-service department to “cut costs.”  
Now every poor soul, saint or sinner, must pass through **you** — the only remaining gatekeeper who can still read.  

Armed with a **newspaper full of questionable journalism**, a shaky sense of morality, and a mug of cold celestial coffee,  
you must sniff out lies, hypocrisy, and suspiciously good haircuts.  
Be warned: the liars are getting creative. Some even bring props.  

Heaven or Hall?  
You decide… probably wrong.

## 🤡 Meet the Souls  
Expect a colorful cast of dearly departed:  
- The “vegetarian” vampire.  
- The ghost influencer who faked her haunting for views.  
- The politician who promises to “reform Hell from the inside.”  
- And many, many unpaid interns.  

Each one swears they deserve a second chance. You just have to believe them… or not.

## 💀 Warnings  
- May contain lies, mild demonic activity, and existential dread.  
- The Afterlife Department is not responsible for emotional damage caused by misplaced compassion.  
- Absolutely **do not** press both buttons at once. (We tried. It opens a wormhole.)

Welcome to **Heaven or Hall**.
